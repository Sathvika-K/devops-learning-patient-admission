# Patient Admission CLI (DevOps Learning Project)

This repository was created as part of my journey to learn how software builds and deployments work using modern DevOps tools.

##  Purpose
To explore and understand:
- **Gradle** and **Maven** for Java project builds
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD automation
- **Ansible** for configuration management and deployment
- **AWS CodeBuild** (via `buildspec.yml`) for build pipelines

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Gradle & Maven
- Docker
- Jenkins
- Ansible
- AWS CodeBuild
- GitHub Actions (optional future integration)

##  Notes
This is a learning-focused repository â€” not a production system.  
It helped me understand how each tool integrates into a real DevOps workflow from code to deployment.
